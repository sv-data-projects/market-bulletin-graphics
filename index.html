        <h1>SV Recovered Resources Market Bulletin graphics index</h1>
        <div>
            <p>This page contains links to HTML/SVG/JS based data visualisations that (will be) embedded into various sections of online version of the <a href = 'https://www.sustainability.vic.gov.au/research-data-and-insights/waste-data/recovered-resources-market-bulletin' target="_blank">SV Recovered Resources Market Bulletin</a>.
                The aim for each of these visualisations is that they will automatically update when data is updated in the supporting data tables. 
                Because there a need to archive editions of the Market Bulletin with charts displaying relavent (historical) dates, each ot these apps includes the ability to request dates using a query string (detailed below for each app/link)
            </p>
            <p> All graphics are designed as small single page data-driven apps that are embeddable on the SV wesbite using the "Advanced Data Visualisation" entry, with D3 selected as the "Entry Type" (in the SV website CMS).
                This option allows for HTML pages (i.e. like those linked) below to be embedded in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe" target="_blank">iframes</a> on the SV website content pages. 
                It should be noted that for embedded content to properly size in the CMS the <a href="https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer"> iframe resizer</a> library is required to be included in the embedded app (and has been included as a CDN link in al of the links below) 
            </p>
            <p>The linked dataset supporting these visualisations can be found and updated <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rg66KhwEbN_FhpD0hhdd6SMIb9ApKlxh_93N4y9Qx_s/edit#gid=549382680" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                These tables should be replaced with connectors to SV operated cloud database services (when available) - the current data connection is made to a text file database (tab seperated values) provided by the Google Sheets service. 
                These connections are supported by the <a href="https://d3js.org/" target = "_blank">D3.js</a> library.
            </p>
            <p> The GitHub repository (i.e. code) for these visualisations and apps can be found <a href = "https://github.com/littlesketches/sv-stuff" target = "_blank"> here</a> (note: this will be moved to a SV data team repo shortly).             
            </p>

            <p class = 'highlight'>CURRENT STATUS - 26-Aug PM</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All vis apps refactored and tested => Removed dependency on PapaParse (now D3 fetch) and centralised data table links and brand styling</li>
                <li>Data source (tables) and all code and CSS styling  have all been changed to reflect standardised labelling (i.e. 'Paper and cardboard', 'Plastics', 'Metals' and 'Glass'</li>
                <li>Graphics tested for embedding in the CMS version of the Market Bulletin: successful pending with minor optimisation to come in final</li>
                <li>Styling optimisation and application of proposed standardised materials colour palette applied</li>
                <li>Accessiblity optmisation in progress (ETA with final on 31-Aug)</li>
                <li>Flows diagram mostly complete pending: data and treatment/labelling of contamination flows. The 'system' view may eventually be be removed or completed with better illustations </li>
                <li>Value chain price diagrams are pending feedback on which sub-material prices to include, and where all should be positioned </li>
                <li>An option to download the source data series data may be included </li>
                <li>Documentation on query strings to be added: this will mostly apply to choosing dates and date ranges to display</li>
            </ul>

                <p class = 'highlight'> About the visualisations</p>
                <p>There are five separate code bases that support these visualisations:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Kerbside collection flows: is an application that supports the kerbside flows graphic only. It is connected to the 'data_mrfOutput' table</li>
                    <li>Time series charts: is an application that supports all interactive line, area and layer (stacked area) charts. These charts are individually configured (from JS objects located directly in their HTML page) to connect to either the 'data_mrfOutput' or 'data_materialsVicExport' tables</li>
                    <li>Materials dashboard: is an application that supports the 'flow, price and exports' dashboards and individual components used as 'performance tables'. These are connected to either or all of the 'data_mrfOutput', 'data_materialsVicExport' and 'data_commodityValues' tables</li>

                    <li>Value chain price: is a small application that supports the value chain pricing diagrams. It's geometry (i.e. positioning of node and price labels) is configured from an JS object (editable from within its main.js code) and is connected to the 'data_commodityValues' tables</li>
                    <li>Market capacity tables: is a small application that produces the colour-coded end market capacity tables (as colour-coded tables are not currently supported by the CMS). Its inputs (including date for publication) are contained in the 'data_marketCapacity' tables</li>
                </ol>
                <p> Further reference documentation will be added to each applications github repo page (soon).</p>
